FIELD CENTRIC DRIVE for FIRST-GEN Vex IQ Brain.

This is a personal project done on RobotC for VIQ.

This is designed NOT TO BE used with any robot rather than a practice chassis I assembled:

Feel free to adapt the code to your robot!



Please, I have no IQ kit, so please imform me of any issues with the code and which part is failing, so I can check it.
